# Qurani
Simple Application that helps you memorize quran!

## About

I believe what makes this is app special that it's minimalist design, and that is it's very easy to use, and it's made for special purpose, not mainly for reading quran, or studying tafsirs, but for memorizing quran, by repeating Ayat for selected ranges over and over again.

## How this thing work?

I really made the application long time ago, and didn't have the chance to publish it to the AppStore until now, but I hope I'll go back to discover how it's made, and I really appreciate any help constributing to this project.

## Future ToDO's

- Depending on Pages like the regular Quran, that's a more friendly UI.
- Adding Qari's, and that's cause the networking part made to make this feature a lot easier to implement
